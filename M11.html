									<p>The natural history of the disease is the progression of a disease over time and understanding how it evolves is fundamental to learn what can we do to avoid its progression. 
									</p><p>Many diseases have certain relatively well-defined and well-known stages in which different types of preventive measures can be applied. 

									<hr />

									<h2>The disease process</h2>
									<p>The disease process begins with the exposure to risk and etiological factors in a susceptible host (1). 
										At this stage, primary prevention (2) focuses on protecting healthy individuals from the biological onset of disease by means of health promotion and health protection interventions. Therefore, primary prevention strategies aim to reduce the incidence of disease by eliminating exposure to risk factors or by increasing population resistance to risk factors. 
										In cervical cancer the main primary prevention action is avoiding exposure to oncogenic HPV types, the necessary cause of cervical cancer, through vaccination.</p>

									<hr />

									<h2>Screening</h2>
									<p>In some individuals, the disease process is triggered, and pathological changes start, normally without the individuals being aware of them (asymptomatic). This is known as the subclinical stage of the disease or the latency period.  
									</p><p>At this stage, secondary prevention or screening (2) consists of the systematic application of safe, easy-to-use and economically affordable tests, to provide early diagnosis of disease followed by timely treatment. 
										</p><p>
										
										
										In cervical cancer, it can take decades for an HPV infection to progress to cancer. Therefore, secondary prevention consists of the detection of precancerous lesions caused by persistent infection of HPV using cytology or HPV testing.</p>
