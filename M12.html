              Screening tests are applied to subjects without clinical symptoms
              of disease. Therefore, potential tests need to be evaluated
              carefully in order to limit the potentially negative consequences
              on health outcomes (delay at diagnosis, false positive results,
              etc) and health system expenditures.

              A perfect test will classify all women either as TP or TN (100%
              sensitivity and 100% specificity). However, tests rarely classify
              all subjects correctly according to their disease status since
              there is an overlap of the distribution of patients with disease
              with those that don’t have it. there are no perfect tests
              therefore our efforts will be directed to minimize false results
              (FP and FN).

                HPV tests aim to detect HPV persistent infections as the
                etiological factors for cervical precancer and cancer. However,
                because we still cannot differentiate acute with persistent
                infections, we may sometimes identify an HPV infection that will
                clear spontaneously and not causing disease.

            <h3>IMPORTANT</h3>
            <blockquote>
              An ideal screening test should have the maximum sensitivity and
              specificity, but in real life this is almost impossible to
              accomplish, and screening tests do not classify patients
              perfectly. The prevalence of the majority of tumours among the
              general population is low. Therefore, a low test specificity
              results in a considerable proportion of false positives, leading
              to higher costs and adverse effects. In real life, the decision of
              the screening test might also consider whether additional
              diagnostic tests are available or not. In life-threatening
              diseases such as cancer, the main interest is that the subjects
              with disease are referred for further diagnosis, therefore a high
              sensitivity is needed to discard that participants are classified
              as false negatives. In general terms, we may prefer a test with
              higher sensitivity at the cost of reducing specificity. Additional
              tests are generally performed in screen positives aiming to at
              reduce unnecessary referrals for final diagnosis and/or treatment
              by increasing specificity. This step is called TRIAGE.

            <h3>Predictive values</h3>
            <p>
              Clinicians are generally interested in the detection or absence of
              disease based on the results of the test being applied. Predictive
              values denote the probability that the test gives the correct
              diagnosis (8):
            </p>
            <p>
              From the 2 by 2 table (Table 1), we can compute predictive values
              as follows.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                PPV measures the probability of presence of disease when the
                test is positive (proportion of patients with a positive test
                result that are correctly diagnosed). Low PPV values indicate a
                substantial number of unnecessary subsequent testing, important
                in the event of performing invasive tests in FP subjects.<br /><b
                  >PPV = TP / (TP+FP)</b
                >
              </li>
              <li>
                NPV measures the probability of absence of disease when the test
                is negative, the proportion of patients with a negative test
                result that are not ill.<br /><b>NPV = TN / (TN+FN)</b>

            <p>
              Predictive values are affected by disease prevalence. The PPV of a
              test increases with increasing prevalence, while the NPV decreases
              with increasing prevalence of disease. Both increase with severity
              of disease (9). Therefore, PPV and NPV from one study should not
              be transferred to other settings with difference prevalence of
              disease. As well, careful interpretation should be done of test
              accuracy conducted in referred populations after a positive
              screening test result where the prevalence of disease is higher.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sensitivity and specificity have been traditionally regarded as
              constant benchmarks of test performance and they are frequently
              used to compare the diagnostic value of different tests.
              Nevertheless, sensitivity and specificity, are also affected by
              disease prevalence (9).
            </p>
            <p>
              When the prevalence of the disease is very low, the PPV will be
              substantially low even if sensitivity and specificity are high.
              Therefore, many people with a positive result who do not have the
              disease (false positives) will unnecessarily undergo subsequent
              testing.
            </p>
            <h3>Likelihood Ratios</h3>
            <p>
              From sensitivity and specificity we can obtain the LR, which
              summarises how many times more (or less) patients with the disease
              are likely to have a particular result than patients without the
              disease (10).
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A positive likelihood ratio (LR+) indicates how many times more
                likely a positive test occurs in subjects with the disease than
                in those without the disease. The farther LR+ is from 1, the
                stronger evidence for the presence of the disease. LR above 10
                are considered to provide enough strong evidence to confirm
                diagnosis in most of the circumstances. If LR+ is equal to 1,
                the test is not able to distinguish ill from healthy
                individuals. <br /><b>LR+ = Sensitivity / (1-Specificity)</b
                ><br /><span class="bgamarillo"
                  >A high LR+ indicates that the test is useful, but it does not
                  necessarily indicate that a positive test is a good indicator
                  of the presence of disease.</span
                >
              </li>
              <li>
                A negative likelihood ratio (LR-) indicates how much less likely
                the negative test result is to occur in a subject with the
                disease than in a healthy subject. When LR is below 0.1, it is
                considered to provide enough evidence to exclude diagnosis in
                most of the circumstances. The lower LR- is, the stronger the
                evidence for the absence of disease. <br /><b
                  >LR- = (1-Sensitivity) / Specificity</b
                >
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Since sensitivity and specificity are used to calculate the LR,
              both LR+ and LR- depend again on disease prevalence.

              Likelihood ratios range from zero to infinity. The higher the
              value, the more likely the patient has the condition. As an
              example, let’s say a positive test result has an LR of 9.2. This
              result is 9.2 times more likely to happen in a patient with the
              condition than it would in a patient without the condition.

                <span class="bgamarillo">&nbsp;0 to 1: </span>
                &nbsp;Decreased evidence for disease. Values closer to zero have
                a higher decrease in probability of disease. For example, a LR
                of 0.1 decreases probability by -45%, while a value of -0.5
                decreases probability by -15%.

              <li>

                <span class="bgamarillo">&nbsp;Above 1: </span>

                &nbsp;Increased evidence for disease. The farther away from 1,
                the more chance of disease. For example, a LR of 2 increases the
                probability by 15%, while a LR of 10 increases the probability
                by 45%. An LR over 10 is very strong evidence to rule in a
                disease.

            <h3>Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve</h3>
            <p>
              Many diagnostic tests are quantitative and a cut-off point has to
              be established to distinguish health and disease status. The ROC
              curve is the representation of all the pairs of sensitivity and
              specificity values for all the cut-offs that could be established
              in the test evaluated.

                <p>
                  On the ROC curve, the x-axis represents 1-specificity (the
                  false positive rate) while the y axis represents sensitivity
                  (true positive rate) <span class="figuras">(FIGURE 3)</span>.
                  The shape of the ROC curve as well as the area under the curve
                  (AUC) allows the estimation of how high the discriminative
                  power of a test is: the closer the curve is located to the
                  upper-left corner (highest sensitivity and specificity), the
                  larger the AUC is and, therefore, the better the test is at
                  discriminating health and disease. An AUC of 1 represents the
                  perfect test, with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. An
                  AUC of 0.5 represents a worthless test that does not allow
                  discrimination (sensitivity is 50% and specificity is 50%),
                  which is similar as tossing a coin.

              Once screening tests are well validated and applied to human
              populations, to properly assess the impact or effectiveness of
              screening programs there are some biases to be considered.

                <p>
                  Screening allows identifying disease earlier, so treatment can
                  start at an early phase in order to imply a longer survival.
                  However, this jump in the detection of the disease may imply a
                  bias. A screening program is not useful when there is an
                  increase in survival but not a prolongation in life (i.e., die
                  at the same time point as if not diagnosed earlier) (2). For
                  example, consider two subjects with a similar natural history
                  of disease, subject A is not screened whereas subject B is.
                  Subject B appears to survive longer than subject A, but only
                  because the disease was identified earlier

                <h3>Length time bias</h3>
                <p>
                  Some cancers may have longer detectable preclinical phases
                  than others, while others may be more aggressive and rapidly
                  progress (2). Screening will probably detect those cancers
                  with longer detectable preclinical phases, which are more
                  likely to be more indolent than those that are not detected by
                  screening <span class="figuras">(FIGURE 5)</span>. Therefore,
                  this could result in an increase in diagnoses (at higher cost,
                  and potential harms and side effects of diagnosis and
                  treatments) but not in a reduced mortality because these
                  cancers would never have resulted in death.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overdiagnosis bias is an extreme form of length-time bias
                  (12). The detection of very indolent tumours in the screened
                  group produces apparent increases in the number of cancer
                  cases. Randomised trials with mortality rates as the endpoint
                  can overcome lead and length-time biases.

              <h3>EXAMPLE</h3>
              <p>
                Impotence and incontinence are common side effects of usual
                therapy for prostate cancer. These consequences outweigh the
                alternative in aggressive forms of prostate cancer. However, a
                considerable proportion of men with prostate cancer have
                slow-growing tumours that would have been unlikely to be
                diagnosed or cause harm but if detected and treated could
                unnecessarily suffer of these side effects (12).
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Selection bias</h3>
            <p>
              A self-selection bias may occur because participants may be
              healthier and adhere better to cancer prevention recommendations,
              as well as to therapy when they are cancer patients. Similarly,
              patients with higher cancer risk because of a family history of
              cancer may attend more frequently to screening programs (13).
              Therefore the outcomes associated with these populations may be
              better and bias the apparent value of the screening program.
