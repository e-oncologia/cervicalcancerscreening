              The natural history of the disease is the progression of a disease
              over time and understanding how it evolves is fundamental to learn
              what can we do to avoid its progression.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many diseases have certain relatively well-defined and well-known
              stages in which different types of preventive measures can be
              applied <span class="figuras">(FIGURE 1)</span>.

                <div class="cajaB">
                <p>
                  The disease process begins with the exposure to risk and
                  etiological factors in a susceptible host (1).
                </p>
                <p>
                  At this stage, primary prevention (2) focuses on protecting
                  healthy individuals from the biological onset of disease by
                  means of health promotion and health protection
                  interventions. Therefore, primary prevention strategies aim
                  to reduce the incidence of disease by eliminating exposure
                  to risk factors or by increasing population resistance to
                  risk factors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In cervical cancer the main primary prevention action is
                  avoiding exposure to oncogenic HPV types, the necessary
                  cause of cervical cancer, through vaccination.
                </p>
              </div></div>
              <div id="myDIV2" style="display:none">
                <div class="cajaC">
                <p>
                  In some individuals, the disease process is triggered, and
                  pathological changes start, normally without the individuals
                  being aware of them (asymptomatic). This is known as the
                  subclinical stage of the disease or the latency period.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At this stage, secondary prevention or screening (2)
                  consists of the systematic application of safe, easy-to-use
                  and economically affordable tests, to provide early
                  diagnosis of disease followed by timely treatment. Secondary
                  prevention aims to identify the existence of health problems
                  before they get worse, provide treatment at an early stage
                  and to improve disease prognosis. Therefore, screening aims
                  at reducing the disease prevalence by shortening its
                  duration, reducing the incidence of complications associated
                  with the disease and increasing the quality of life of those
                  affected by the disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In cervical cancer, it can take decades for an HPV infection
                  to progress to cancer. Therefore, secondary prevention
                  consists of the detection of precancerous lesions caused by
                  persistent infection of HPV using cytology or HPV testing.
                </p>
            </div>
          </div>
              <div id="myDIV3" style="display:none">
                <div class="cajaD">
                <p>
                  At some point, the disease start to be symptomatic and
                  individuals look for medical assistance. Ultimately, the
                  disease process ends either in recovery, disability or
                  death.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tertiary prevention aims to decrease the impact of an
                  ongoing disease. It consists of managing the long-term
                  disease (avoid complications and relapses) to reduce
                  morbidity, disability and mortality among those diagnosed
                  and being treated for the disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The presentation and course of cancer will vary in different
                  individuals and contexts, even for the same disease. In
                  cervical cancer, HPV infections may never progress to cancer
                  for most women but in a few others the process may result in
                  severe or fatal illness. This is called the spectrum of
                  disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The table below shows the different strategies or
                  interventions that are being used to prevent the exposure to
                  HPV, its progression to cervical cancer and the mitigating
                  measures once the cancer has been diagnosed.

                    A group of experts assessed the available evidence on cancer
                    prevention to develop the European Code against Cancer (3), a
                    list of 12 recommendations on actions that individual European
                    citizens can take to help prevent cancer:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Do not smoke. Do not use any form of tobacco.</li>
                    <li>
                      Make your home smoke free. Support smoke-free policies in your
                      workplace.
                    </li>
                    <li>Take action to be a healthy body weight.</li>
                    <li>
                      Be physically active in everyday life. Limit the time you
                      spend sitting.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Have a healthy diet:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Eat plenty of whole grains, pulses, vegetables and fruits.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Limit high-calorie foods (foods high in sugar or fat) and
                          avoid sugary drinks.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Avoid processed meat; limit red meat and foods high in
                          salt.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If you drink alcohol of any type, limit your intake. Not
                      drinking alcohol is better for cancer prevention.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Avoid too much sun, especially for children. Use sun
                      protection. Do not use sunbeds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In the workplace, protect yourself against cancer-causing
                      substances by following health and safety instructions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Find out if you are exposed to radiation from naturally high
                      radon levels in your home. Take action to reduce high radon
                      levels.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For women:<br />
                      Breastfeeding reduces cancer risk. If you can, breastfeed your
                      baby. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases the risk of
                      certain cancers. Limit use of HRT.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Ensure your children take part in vaccination programmes for:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Hepatitis B (for new-borns).</li>
                        <li>Human papillomavirus (HPV) (for girls).</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Take part in organized cancer screening programmes for:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Bowel cancer (men and women)</li>
                      <li>Breast cancer (women)</li>
                      <li>Cervical cancer (women)</li>
                    </ul>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    Yet, successful cancer prevention requires these individual
                    actions to be supported by governmental policies and actions.
                  </p>

            <h2>1.2 Wilson and Jungner 10 principles of screening</h2>
          </section>
          <section class="main">
            <p>
              Screening is the action of actively searching for a disease in an
              asymptomatic population. However, not all diseases can be
              screened. A disease should fulfil some requirements before it is
              considered as a candidate for screening (see box below).
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1968, Wilson and Jungner enumerated ten principles to be
              considered before undertaking a screening program. These criteria
              are key in understanding the complexity and requirements of a
              screening program (4,5).

           <p>The target disease should be an important health problem, either for its frequency or for its severity. The natural history of the disease needs to be well-understood and there should be sufficient data on the incidence and prevalence of the disease in a specific setting, as well as evidence on the association between disease markers and progression (natural history of disease) and the implications (clinical, psychological, economical) of resulting positive in the screening test.</p>
            <p>Besides these classic criteria, additional programmatic criteria are also critical:</p>
